- [DONE] loop on all mRNA channels
- [DONE] use list generators
- [DONE] fix pyCharm python highlighting
- [DONE] check that it still works from the command line
- [DONE] make notebooks?
- [DONE] oneliner to open vsi picture + DIC layer (layer order, scale, color, blending)
- [DONE] fix Git situation
- [DONE] deduplicate images 240927
- [DONE] automatically set slice to in-focus slice (with value from spot detection)
- [LATER] fix Git situation for real (git-lfs + Zenodo)
- [LATER] pytest tests
- fix envs mess
- histograms in napari or matplotlib; automatic contrast adapted to mRNA channels and DIC
- [NEXT] plot what we actually want to analyse: per condition/growth rate,
  - number of cells
  - number of spots
  - number of spots/Txs per cell
  - number of RNA per Tx
  - distance between spots/Txs and nucleoid
  - spots vs. cell size
  - spots vs. eccentricity
- [NEXT] optimise Omnipose segmentations
  - nucleoid segmentation
    - was this trip really necessary? Segmenting a 2D projection adds a lot of arbitrariness
    - can we not compute distance between putative transcription site and nucleoid in 3D?
- [MAYBE] deskew MG1655_LB images
- [MAYBE] use duplicate images to test analysis pipeline (do I get the same results with two duplicates?)
- [MAYBE] manually add a "valid" mask to exclude parts of the picture where DIC is screwed up (e.g. MG16555_MAN_OD_0.3_left_10)
