- [DONE] loop on all mRNA channels
- [DONE] use list generators
- [DONE] fix pyCharm python highlighting
- [DONE] check that it still works from the command line
- [DONE] make notebooks?
- [DONE] oneliner to open vsi picture + DIC layer (layer order, scale, color, blending)
- [DONE] fix Git situation
- [DONE] deduplicate images 240927
- automatically set slice to in-focus slice (with value from spot detection)
- fix Git situation for real (git-lfs + Zenodo)
- pytest tests
- optimise Omnipose segmentations
- nucleoid segmentation
  - was this trip really necessary? Segmentating a 2D projection adds a lot of arbitrariness
  - can we not compute distance between putative transcription site and nucleoid in 3D?
- plot what we actually want to analyse
- deskew MG1655_LB images
- use duplicate images to test analysis pipeline (do I get the same results with two duplicates?)
- manually add a "valid" mask to exclude parts of the picture where DIC is screwed up (e.g. MG16555_MAN_OD_0.3_left_10)
